# Electro Sounds

An introductory class to coding, algorithms, and screen-based visuals.


## Semester 2

Creative Coding has become a household name in many art, design and music communities around the world. In addition to the traditional and established means and skills for creative expression in education and the creative industries, programming has seen continuous development as a skill.

Since the early 2000s, various coding frameworks and communities have emerged that have created a variety of learning tools and creative outcomes generated by the use of code and other technologies. Being code literate has become a desirable skill for a variety of practices and professions in the creative industries and other industries.

With an initial focus on generating screen-based results, the range of applications and artistic expressions has been highly diversified and now includes outcomes that oftne merge sound, interactivity, advanced technologies, physical objects, data and more.

This semester, we will focus on skills and strategies that are essential for generating sound and images using code and algorithms. You will use and create your own generative systems with a range of coding techniques and good ideas. First, a quote from Philip Galanter from his article What is Generative Art?

> Generative art refers to any art practice where the artist uses a system, such as a set of natural language rules, a computer program, a machine, or other procedural invention, which is set into motion with some degree of autonomy contributing to or resulting in a completed work of art.

_P. Galanter, "What is Generative Art? Complexity theory as a context for art theory," in International Conference on Generative Art, Milan, Italy, 2003._


In this course we will focus on the technical aspects of coding, but it is strongly recommended that you immerse yourself in the subject with an open mind for cultural, theoretical and contextual discussions to shape your artistic thinking and creativity. A number of examples and starting points are offered and discussed during each lesson and in this repository.

## Misc

  1. To keep your code organised and in one place, use Github (create an account for free) to host your code repositories. Github offers a GUI [desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/) that makes it very easy to create and update repositories. Please read through
    - [Getting your project on Github](https://guides.github.com/introduction/getting-your-project-on-github/) using the github Desktop application
    - [Github's Clone to Desktop](http://joe.blog.freemansoft.com/2014/04/github-clone-to-desktop-with-windows.html) shows you how to clone a repository to your local desktop using Github's Desktop application. This is very useful to for example keep track of the class repository which will continuously be updated as we proceed.
  2. Some exercises require you to write short texts which are write in markdown ([what is it](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), [tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com)),
  3. A very simple formatting syntax for writing text in text editors like TextEdit, Sublime Text, or Atom. On maxos add a markdown quickview (for example [qlmarkdown](https://github.com/toland/qlmarkdown/releases) but there are more out there) to see your document rendered in markdown when quick-viewing it.
	4. How to convert your markdown document to pdf? Use [mdpdf](https://github.com/BlueHatbRit/mdpdf)
  4. Some insightful tips about being a beginner, intermediate or advanced programmer: [A guide on how to be a programmer](https://github.com/braydie/HowToBeAProgrammer)
  5. To convert a video to another format, consider using the open source video transcoder [handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/)
