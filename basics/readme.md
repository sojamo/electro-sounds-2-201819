# Electro Sounds: Basics

In this section we will prepare a basic development setup and look into a number of programming principles that will help you to develop a better understanding of how to create generative visual representations using JavaScript. We will use the [p5js](https://p5js.org) library in class. Alternatively you might want to look into [three.js](https://threejs.org), a cross-browser JavaScript library used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser, as well.

Inside this folder you will find instructions to

1. setup a basic development environment
2. install node
3. create a local http server

After you have successfully set up your development environment, lets continue with _Coding Basics_:

1. Variables
2. Functions
3. Conditionals
4. Loops
5. Arrays
6. Objects
7. Shapes
